This is a basic create react-app using Yarn. I've done a few things to make the creation of new apps a bit faster.

1. Installed node-sass.
1. Installed routing.
1. Edited the `<head>`.
1. Made some starter pages.
1. Made some starter components.
1. Deleted a lot of the "extra" code that comes with create react-app.
